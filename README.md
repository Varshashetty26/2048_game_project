2048 is a popular and addictive puzzle game where the player's goal is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the coveted 2048 tile. The game starts with two tiles (usually numbered 2 or 4) on the grid, and the player must swipe in four directions (up, down, left, or right) to slide all tiles in that direction. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum. The player continues combining tiles strategically while trying to prevent the grid from filling up until they reach the 2048 tile or can no longer make valid moves. It's a challenging and mentally stimulating game that tests your puzzle-solving skills and strategic thinking.
